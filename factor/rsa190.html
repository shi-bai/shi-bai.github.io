"the number was factored by I.Popovyan from MSU, Russia and A. Timofeev from CWI, Netherlands and took a few months of a pure computer time on various parallel systems in both MSU and CWI" <a href = "http://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=14177">(mersenneforum)</a>.

The polynomial they used is (information generated by CADO-NFS),<br/>

This polynomial seems to be the best one along its neighbour rotation space (10000x50000000000) by rootsieve in CADO-NFS.



<h3>Polynomial</h3>

The polynomial was generated using the (very) large prime variant of <a href="http://people.epfl.ch/thorsten.kleinjung">Thorsten Kleinjung </a>'s algorithm. The root sieve was done in the following way. First, rotates many raw polynomials along the best sublattice and treat them as raw polynomials, then run msieve on these rotated polynomials. However, it seems (countering to my initial purpose) that the only effect of doing the rotation is to enlarge the size of the polynomial.  Now, CADO-NFS might be able to do this directly. Finally, several sieve tests are done to pick the following polynomial.

<h3>Sieving</h3>
Lattice sieve was done in lasieve. Until 8 Nov, 322598211 unique relations were collected. The msieve gave a matrix of size 45Mx45M. Some more sieving will be done until the taking-down of the cluster next week.
