Dear Colleagues,

We report the factorization of RSA704, the following 704-bit (212 digits)
number from RSA's challenge list:

740375634795617128280467960974295731425931888892312890849362326389727
650340282662768919964196251178439958943305021275853701189680982867331

96359

The factors are

9091213529597818878440658302600437485892608310328358720428512168960411

and

360133004116702003240828777970252499

Both factors have 352 bits and 106 digits. We denote by p the larger
factor and q the other one. We have the following factorizations,

p-1 = 2^2 * 5 * 17 * 7759 * 248701 * 3311937667 * 1669783862489 *
      1880450644642000493838449 * p49

p+1 = 2 * 3^2 * 43 * 71 * 157 * 2630713 * 1850017111 *
      1040072485315298476627 * 2023909737931501893269845781 * p36

q-1 = 2 * 19 * 149 * 233 * 426163 * 34302641 * 415283201 * p79

q+1 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^4 * 8753 * 27539 * 962945197 * p85

where pK denotes a K-digit prime number.

The factorization is done by CADO-NFS (http://cado-nfs.gforge.inria.fr),
an open source implementation of the number field sieve.

[Polynomial selection]

We used the following degree-6 polynomial for the algebraic side,

f(x) = 10614120 * x6
     + 62813641710611 * x5
     + 1938361239259842311964 * x4
     + 931957113890545875115664715 * x3
     - 11187228497714282733145127980606483 * x2
     + 275791344247583495761263211927712634450 * x
     + 631618785519411550157074523461307229101210175

and

g(x) = 1701314346829200310007393599 * x
     - 10040119372014939875708192394943108

for the rational side.

Polynomial selection started in April 2011 and completed in June 2011.
The total time spent on polynomial selection was about 12 core years.

[Sieving]

We did lattice sieving for special q between 5e8 and 100e8 using factor
base bounds 250e6 on the rational side and 500e6 on the algebraic side.
Sieving started on June 20, 2011 using clusters both at ANU and Inria
Nancy-Grand Est. On February 26, 2012, a total of 1,313,935,004 raw
relations were collected. The total time spent on sieving was about
500 core years.

[Filtering]

The 1,313,935,004 raw relations gave 832,908,644 unique relations. After
purge and merge, the final matrix had about 89M rows and columns, with
17720843456 non-zero coefficients and 16568894691 in the sparse part.

[Linear algebra and square root]

The linear algebra started on March 19, 2012 on the french Gridâ€™5000
computer grid. The block Wiedemann algorithm has been used. The two
computational-intense phases, krylov and mksol, took about 1800h of
wall-clock time on clusters of varying size. Linear algebra was completed
on June 29, 2012.  We found the factors one day later, on June 30, 2012.
